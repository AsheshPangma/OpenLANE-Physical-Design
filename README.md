## Initalizing OpenLANE
In Linux Ubuntu, to invoke OpenLANE, we should first run docker everytime. In our case, we invoke OpenLANE in openlane directory. The script is as follow:
`docker`
There are two modes of operation for OpenLANE: interactive and autonomous.
To invoke openLANE run `./flow.tcl`.
In our workshop, We use interactive mode by running `./flow.tcl -interactive`
